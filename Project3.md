### Step 2: installation of expressjs was done successfully.

#### ExpressJs is a server side web application which is also a framework that is been used by node.js to perform its operations. In mern stack ExpressJs is been installed also in order to get optimum functionality.

##### I have also created a folder called 'Todo', this is where my npm project would be stored.

 #### Step 4: MongoDb configuration using the mlab. this provides mongoDB database as a service solution. i signed up on the mlab and created a cluster which after i created a database for my project.
##### After the connection string have been configured we then test our project by running the cmd "node index.js" which would test if the database is connected succsessfully.
